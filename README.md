# Youtube-Video-Player
In this project, we create a copy of this specific youtube website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V74l_zS1x8E by using CSS and html5. We managed to divide the website into semantic sections which are: the navbar for the search bar and menu buttons, a section for the video, an aside for related videos and an article for the comments. We used different pictures for each one of the buttons, and for the user icons in the comments and we also imported and used the Lato font from Google to better format the text of the website.
